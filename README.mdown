Features
--------

### Automatic URL scraping

IRCBot is capable of detecting URLs in messages sent to IRC channels. Upon detection of URLs, it automatically downloads the first 8192 bytes of the URL and parses it for the HTML title element, which it helpfully sends to the channel. If the link is not an HTML document, it returns the content type and content length properties instead.

### Fortune commands

Users are able to 'ask' IRCBot to make decisions for them (chosen purely randomly by the bot). The bot will respond in accordance to the decision given.

> 23:10 <~got_milk> !decide herp or derp

> 23:10 <&BOT> got_milk: herp

> 23:15 <~got_milk> !decide should I herp?

> 23:15 <&BOT> got_milk: No

### Shout mechanism

If a user shouts in a channel (uppercase text greater than 5 characters) IRCBot will take notice and store the "quote" in a database, while selecting a quote at random to shout back at the user. Users are able to query the bot which can provide the quote submitter and when the quote was added to the database.

> 23:15 <+PhreeWilly> THE ONE AND ONLY!

> 23:15 <&actnotok> OHISHOULDHAVEYELLEDMORESORRY

> 23:17 <~got_milk> !who last

> 23:17 <&actnotok> got_milk: Sunoiki shouted "OHISHOULDHAVEYEL..." about 4 hours ago.

### Seen command

Users can use the !seen command to find out when the last time a user was in the channel.

> 20:44 <~got_milk> !seen BOT

> 20:44 <&BOT> got_milk: I don't think that command means what you think it means.

### Anope-style shorthand op fantasy commands

IRCBot accurately mimics the shorthand kick and ban functions that Anope's BotServ provides. Ops can choose to kick/ban users with or without reasoning.

> 20:44 <~got_milk> .k CrazyAl90 need this for documentation, thanks :)

> 20:44 -!- CrazyAl90 was kicked from #rddt by BOT [need this for documentation, thanks :) (got_milk)]

### Calculator and Google-powered conversions

Users can use the IRCBot to evaluate basic mathematical expressions. IRCBot supports adhering to the order of operations and correctly handles operator precedence.

> 21:08 <~got_milk> !calc (4 * 2)^2

> 21:08 < BOT> got_milk: 64.0

IRCBot is also capable of performing conversions, backed by Google.

> 21:10 <~got_milk> !convert 125CAD to USD

> 21:10 < BOT> got_milk: 125 Canadian dollars is 126.05875 U.S. dollars

### Game Server querying (Source Engine based games)

IRCBot can query servers provided by users to return their status. IRCBot supports querying Source Engine based games, including: Counter-Strike: Source and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Half-Life 2 Deathmatch, Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2, Garry's Mod, Team Fortress 2 and more.
